# TITLE : STOCK MARKET PREDICTION

## 1. Methodology
This project utilizes Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm, to predict stock prices. For data with timeframes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) come in handy but recent researches have shown that LSTM, networks are the most popular and useful variants of RNNs. 

I have used Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using historical closing price and trading volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time and the optimal parameters for the model.
## 2. Description

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Tensor-flow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
